- Discrete Cosine Transform. [dct.py](/blob/master/dct.py) contains a implementation of the DCT, following the values and algorithms from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Discrete_cosine_transform)
- Huffman Entropy Encoding. [huffman.py](/blob/master/huffman.py) generates a codebook for symbols based on their frequency and encodes the DCT'd data.
